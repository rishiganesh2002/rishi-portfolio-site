        "description": "Joined my friends out of college to build an AI-native ecommerce platform. We scaled from zero to ~20 signed customers after raising pre-seed funding.\n\nBuilt the core storefront experience that 18 live stores use - everything from shopping carts and checkout to real-time inventory. Also shipped conversational commerce where customers can chat with AI to find products, which boosted click-through rates and handled almost half of customer support tickets.\n\nCreated analytics dashboards where you can literally talk to your data and get instant charts, plus unified ad management across Google, Meta, TikTok that uses AI to auto-generate campaigns.",

Built pipelines to wrangle messy data from 40+ locations into something actually useful for training AI models.\n\nAlso created a Telegram bot for customer service that was smart enough to figure out which team should handle each ticket - cut response times by 1-2 days which was huge for customer satisfaction.",

Built a web app where movers could point their phone at stuff and it would automatically track inventory in real-time.\n\nThe cool part was implementing Kalman filtering to make the object detection super smooth across multiple video frames.",

Also worked with the Special Olympics building secure data systems and custom validation features that kept 100+ users' data safe while making everything way more efficient.",

Created a React Native app that cut their workflow time in half by making it super easy to input and visualize event information.\n\nBuilt an internal dashboard where different teams could actually talk to each other and track progress - sounds basic but made a huge difference for their team coordination. Also set up automatic CSV exports so they could easily share impact data with donors.",
